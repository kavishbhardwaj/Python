    "# Executing Multiple Commands in Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore various ways to execute multiple commands in Bash, including how to run commands sequentially, conditionally using `&&` and `||`, and how to use Bash subshells. We'll also provide examples of subshells within subshells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Sequential Execution of Commands using `;`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bash, multiple commands can be executed in sequence using the semicolon (`;`). Each command is executed one after the other, regardless of whether the previous command succeeded or failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# These commands will be executed sequentially, one after another.\n",
    "echo \"Command 1\"; echo \"Command 2\"; echo \"Command 3\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even if one command fails, the next commands will still run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration of failure in sequential commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# The `fakecommand` does not exist and will fail, but the next commands will still be executed.\n",
    "echo \"This is Command 1\"; fakecommand; echo \"This is Command 3\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note:** Although `fakecommand` will fail, the final `echo` statement will still be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Conditional Execution using `&&`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `&&` operator is used to run the second command only if the first command succeeds (i.e., it returns an exit status of 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In this example, the second echo will run only if the first one succeeds.\n",
    "echo \"First Command Succeeded\" && echo \"This will be printed because the first command succeeded\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first command fails, the second command is not executed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Since `fakecommand` will fail, the second echo won't be executed.\n",
    "fakecommand && echo \"This won't be executed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Conditional Execution using `||`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `||` operator is used to run the second command only if the first command fails (i.e., it returns a non-zero exit status).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Since the first command fails, the second command will be executed.\n",
    "fakecommand || echo \"First command failed, so this will be printed\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine `&&` and `||` to create more complex logic. For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# This is an example of a simple if-else-like logic in Bash.\n",
    "# If the first command succeeds, the second one runs; otherwise, the third one runs.\n",
    "echo \"Success\" && echo \"This runs if success\" || echo \"This runs if failure\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Using Parentheses for Subshells\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bash, parentheses `()` are used to execute commands in a subshell. A subshell is a separate instance of the shell, and any changes made to the environment in the subshell do not affect the parent shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Commands inside parentheses will run in a subshell.\n",
    "(date; echo \"This runs in a subshell\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `$BASH_SUBSHELL` is used to indicate the subshell level. If you are in the main shell, it will be 0. Each nested subshell increases this value by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Display the subshell level in both parent shell and subshell\n",
    "echo \"BASH_SUBSHELL level in parent shell: $BASH_SUBSHELL\"\n",
    "(echo \"BASH_SUBSHELL level in subshell: $BASH_SUBSHELL\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Subshells within Subshells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create nested subshells by using parentheses inside parentheses. Each new subshell has its own scope and environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of nested subshells:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# In this example, we nest subshells and display the subshell level using $BASH_SUBSHELL.\n",
    "(ls; echo \"BASH_SUBSHELL level: $BASH_SUBSHELL\"; (date; echo \"Nested BASH_SUBSHELL level: $BASH_SUBSHELL\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The first subshell executes the `ls` command and prints the subshell level.\n",
    "- The second subshell (inside the first one) executes the `date` command and prints the subshell level, which will be one level deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Practical Example: Combining Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's combine several commands in different ways to demonstrate sequential and conditional execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# This example includes:\n",
    "# - Sequential execution using `;`\n",
    "# - Conditional execution using `&&` and `||`\n",
    "echo \"Command 1\"; echo \"Command 2\"; false; echo \"Command 3\" && echo \"This runs only if Command 3 succeeds\" || echo \"This runs if Command 3 fails\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- `Command 1` and `Command 2` will run sequentially.\n",
    "- `false` false: This command is a built-in command in Bash that always returns a failure status \n",
    "- `Command 3` will run.\n",
    "- The `&&` will run.\n",
    "- The `||` will not run the command after it.\n",
    "---\n",
    "***Output:***\n",
    "Command 1\n",
    "Command 2\n",
    "Command 3\n",
    "This runs only if Command 3 succeeds\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Example: Combining Commands with Subshells\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's combine subshells with multiple commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Combining subshells and commands.\n",
    "(echo \"Inside first subshell: $BASH_SUBSHELL\"; (echo \"Inside second subshell: $BASH_SUBSHELL\"; date)) && echo \"Commands completed successfully\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The first subshell prints its subshell level and spawns a nested subshell.\n",
    "- The nested subshell prints its own subshell level and runs the `date` command.\n",
    "- If both subshells succeed, the `&&` condition is satisfied, and the success message is printed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "Let’s dive into a more comprehensive explanation of **file descriptors** in Linux and how they are used with redirection operators like `>`, `>>`, `2>`, etc. I’ll combine the lecture material and add new examples to make this clearer for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **File Descriptors: stdin, stdout, and stderr**\n",
    "In Linux, every process has access to three basic **file descriptors**:\n",
    "1. **stdin (Standard Input)** – This is the default place where a program reads input, usually from the keyboard. It’s represented by the file descriptor number `0`.\n",
    "   - Example: When you type into the terminal, that’s coming from `stdin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **stdout (Standard Output)** – This is where the program sends output, usually to the terminal or console. It’s represented by the file descriptor number `1`.\n",
    "   - Example: When you run `ls`, it prints the list of files to the screen via `stdout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **stderr (Standard Error)** – This is where error messages are sent, separate from regular output, also usually to the terminal. It’s represented by the file descriptor number `2`.\n",
    "   - Example: If you try `ls nonexistentfile`, you’ll get an error message printed through `stderr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Redirection Works**\n",
    "Redirection operators allow you to change where stdin, stdout, and stderr are coming from or going to. By default, they use the terminal, but redirection lets you save output to files or send input from files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Redirection (`>`)**\n",
    "The `>` operator is used to redirect **stdout** to a file, replacing the content of the file if it already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -1 /usr/bin > file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Lists all files in `/usr/bin`, with one file per line (`-1`), and saves the output in `file1.txt`.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: If `file1.txt` already exists, this will **overwrite** it, deleting any previous content.\n",
    "- **Real-life Scenario**: Imagine you’re documenting software installed in the `/usr/bin` directory. Instead of scrolling through the terminal, you redirect the list to `file1.txt` for easy reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ps aux > processes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Saves the list of all running processes to `processes.txt`. You can now open this file later and review it, even after the processes are finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Appending to Files with `>>`**\n",
    "The `>>` operator is used to append output to the end of a file without overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"new line\" >> file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Adds `\"new line\"` to the end of `file1.txt`, without removing anything already in the file.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: This is useful for log files or accumulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "df -h >> disk_usage_log.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Appends the current disk usage status to `disk_usage_log.txt`. This is useful when tracking disk usage over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Redirecting Standard Error (`2>`)**\n",
    "The `2>` operator redirects **stderr** (error messages) to a file. This is useful when you want to capture error messages separately from regular output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls nonexistentfile > file1.txt 2> errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Tries to list a non-existent file, redirecting normal output to `file1.txt` (which will stay empty), and saving the error message (\"No such file or directory\") in `errors.txt`.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: This separates regular output from error messages, which can help you debug issues more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "grep \"pattern\" file1.txt 2> grep_errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Searches for `\"pattern\"` in `file1.txt`. If `file1.txt` doesn’t exist, it writes the error message to `grep_errors.txt`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Combining stdout and stderr in One File (`2>&1`)**\n",
    "If you want both normal output and error messages in the same file, you can combine them using `2>&1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls nonexistentfile > output.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Redirects both normal output (stdout) and error messages (stderr) to `output.txt`. \n",
    "- **Key Point**: This ensures that no information is lost, making it easy to check what went wrong or right by reviewing one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./my_script.sh > log.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Runs `my_script.sh` and saves both the output and error messages to `log.txt`. This is helpful when you’re debugging a script and want to see everything in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Discarding Output: Redirecting to `/dev/null`**\n",
    "The `/dev/null` is a special file that discards everything sent to it. It’s like a \"black hole\" for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Runs `ls` but discards all the output (nothing will be shown or saved).\n",
    "- **Key Point**: You use this when you’re not interested in the output but still want to run the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ping google.com > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Pings Google’s server but discards the output, so you don’t clutter your screen with repeated ping results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Redirecting Input with `<`**\n",
    "The `<` operator is used to redirect input from a file rather than from the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat < file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Reads the content of `file1.txt` and prints it to the screen, just as `cat file1.txt` would.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: This shows that you can feed input into a command from a file, useful when scripting automated tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sort < names.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Reads the file `names.txt`, sorts the lines alphabetically, and prints the result to the screen. If you have a long list of names, this simplifies sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Redirecting Both Input and Output**\n",
    "You can use redirection operators simultaneously to control both where a command reads from and writes to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sort < names.txt > sorted_names.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Reads from `names.txt`, sorts the lines alphabetically, and saves the result in `sorted_names.txt`.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: This is a typical pattern in automation scripts, where you take input, process it, and then save the processed output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using `cat` to Create Files**\n",
    "The `cat` command can be used to create text files or append content to an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat > newfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Waits for you to type text, and whatever you type will be saved in `newfile.txt` when you press `Ctrl+D`.\n",
    "- **Key Point**: This is a quick way to create files, but it’s \"barebones\" and meant for small files or quick text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat >> log.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Appends new text that you type to the end of `log.txt`, useful when you’re quickly adding log entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Security Considerations**\n",
    "- It’s essential to understand file permissions. For example, running `ls > file1.txt` in a directory like `/usr` will give you a **permission denied** error unless you have write access.\n",
    "- **Best Practice**: Avoid using the root account unnecessarily, as accidental redirection could overwrite critical system files. It’s safer to operate with regular user privileges and use `sudo` only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Other Advanced Redirection Concepts**\n",
    "#### **Combining Multiple Commands and Redirections**\n",
    "You can chain commands and redirect the output from one command to another using pipes (`|`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls /usr/bin | grep gcc > gcc_files.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Lists all files in `/usr/bin`, searches for files related to `gcc`, and saves the results in `gcc_files.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Chaining with Error Handling:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls /some/directory | grep file > output.txt 2> errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Redirects the standard output to `output.txt` and any errors (like \"directory not found\") to `errors.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "To summarize:\n",
    "1. Use `>` to redirect stdout (output) to a file, **overwriting** the file.\n",
    "2. Use `>>` to **append** stdout to a file.\n",
    "3. Use `2>` to redirect stderr (errors) to a file.\n",
    "4. Combine stdout and stderr with `2>&1`.\n",
    "5. Discard output by redirecting to `/dev/null`.\n",
    "6. Redirect input using `<`.\n",
    "7. Combine redirection for both input and output.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the content from minute 24 onwards, including all lecture examples and additional insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Understanding File Pointers (stdin, stdout, stderr)**\n",
    "The lecture emphasizes the three key **file descriptors** in Linux:\n",
    "- **stdin** (standard input) is linked to the keyboard, represented by file descriptor 0.\n",
    "- **stdout** (standard output) is linked to the terminal screen, represented by file descriptor 1.\n",
    "- **stderr** (standard error) is also linked to the terminal, used for error messages, represented by file descriptor 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "These file descriptors are key to redirecting the output or input of a command to or from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "To visualize:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Hello, World!\" > output.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This uses `stdout` to redirect the text into a file instead of printing it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Appending vs Overwriting: `>` vs `>>`**\n",
    "The double `>>` is used to **append** content to a file, while a single `>` is used to **overwrite** the file. The lecture discusses how using `>>` ensures that existing content in a file is not erased.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Appending new data\" >> file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Adds `\"Appending new data\"` to the end of `file1.txt`. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Point from the Lecture:**\n",
    "- Using `>>` is a **safer option** when you want to ensure that no data is accidentally erased.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "date >> logs.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Appends the current date and time to `logs.txt`. This is useful for maintaining a running log without overwriting previous entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. File Creation and Permissions**\n",
    "The lecture highlights that, while appending to a file with `>>`, if the file doesn’t exist, it will be created. However, if you attempt to create or modify a file in a directory where you **don’t have write permissions**, an error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"Test\" >> /usr/protected_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What happens**: This command fails with a **permission denied** error because `/usr` is a protected directory that the current user cannot write to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"New entry\" >> /root/newfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Expected Output**: You will receive a permission error unless you have elevated privileges or use `sudo`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Using `cat` to Append and View Files**\n",
    "The lecture demonstrates using the `cat` command to append content to a file and inspect its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat >> file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Lets you manually type input, which is appended to `file1.txt`. After typing, press `Ctrl+D` to save the input to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Checking File Contents:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat file1.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Displays the entire content of `file1.txt` in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cat >> notes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Appends typed notes into `notes.txt`. Press `Ctrl+D` when done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Combining Output and Error Streams (`2>&1`)**\n",
    "In Linux, you can combine both standard output (`stdout`) and error output (`stderr`) into a single file using `2>&1`. This is useful when you want to capture everything in one place for later review.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command > output.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Redirects both the output and any error messages to `output.txt`.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "./run_script.sh > script_log.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Runs `run_script.sh`, saving both the results and any error messages in `script_log.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Using Piping with Redirection**\n",
    "The lecture introduces how to combine commands using pipes (`|`) along with redirection to further process or store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -l /usr/bin | grep python > python_files.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Lists all files in `/usr/bin` with detailed information (`-l`), searches for files related to Python using `grep`, and stores the result in `python_files.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ps aux | grep \"bash\" > bash_processes.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Lists all running processes, filters for those related to `bash`, and saves the output in `bash_processes.txt`.\n",

    "### **7. Practical Use of `/dev/null`**\n",
    "The lecture talks about `/dev/null`, a special file in Linux used to discard any data sent to it. It’s commonly used when you don’t care about the output of a command and want to suppress it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Runs `command`, but discards the output by sending it to `/dev/null`. This keeps the terminal clean if you don’t want to see any output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **My Own Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ping google.com > /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What it does**: Runs a continuous ping to Google's server, but hides the output to avoid cluttering the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Security and User Permissions**\n",
    "The lecture revisits the importance of user permissions, specifically how file creation and modification depend on the user’s access rights in Linux. It’s highlighted that you should always check your permissions before redirecting to or creating files in protected directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch /etc/newfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Expected Output**: You’ll get a permission denied error unless you have elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Point**: Always check your permissions, and be careful when operating as the `root` user to avoid unintended changes to system-critical files.\n",

    "### **Summary of Post-24 Minute Concepts:**\n",
    "Here’s a recap of the key concepts and examples:\n",
    "1. **File Pointers**: stdin, stdout, and stderr.\n",
    "2. **Appending (`>>`) vs Overwriting (`>`)**: How to safely append content to files.\n",
    "3. **Permission Handling**: Errors encountered when trying to write in protected directories.\n",
    "4. **Using `cat`**: Appending and viewing file contents directly from the terminal.\n",
    "5. **Combining stdout and stderr**: Using `2>&1` to capture both outputs in one file.\n",
    "6. **Piping with Redirection**: Using pipes (`|`) to process and redirect command output.\n",
    "7. **Using `/dev/null`**: Discarding unwanted output by sending it to `/dev/null`.\n",
    "8. **Security Considerations**: Being mindful of file permissions and user privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide you with all the information discussed from minute 24 onwards, along with additional practical examples and explanations to clarify each concept. Let me know if you'd like further details or examples on any particular point!"
