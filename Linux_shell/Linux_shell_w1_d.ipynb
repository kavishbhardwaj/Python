    "\n",
    "1. **Most Options Can Be Combined in Any Order**:\n",
    "   - For example, `ls -lS`, `ls -Sl`, and `ls -l -S` will produce the same output because `-l` and `-S` do not conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Some Options Modify the Behavior of Other Options**:\n",
    "   - `ls -d` (show directory itself) when combined with `-l` (`ls -ld`) will show details of the directory itself rather than its contents. The order of `-l -d` or `-d -l` does not change the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grouping of Options**:\n",
    "   - Options can be grouped together, such as `ls -l -t` or `ls -lt`. Grouping options or separating them has no effect on the output as long as the options do not alter each other's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effect of `-R` (Recursive)**:\n",
    "   - The order of `-R` does not matter when combined with other options like `-l` or `-a`. All contents will be listed recursively regardless of where `-R` appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Options That Change Display Behavior (e.g., `-d`, `-l`)**:\n",
    "   - Options like `-d` need careful attention, as `-d` will override other options such as `-R` by preventing recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The order of options generally does not matter, but certain options like `-d` can change how others behave. Be mindful of such options when combining them.\n"

    "### Explanation of Each Section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Arguments\n",
    "- The `mv` and `cp` commands can take multiple source files as arguments, followed by a destination directory.\n",
    "- **Example**: `mv file1.txt file2.txt subdir1/` moves both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to `subdir1/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Argument\n",
    "- The second argument in `mv` and `cp` is typically the destination or target for the operation.\n",
    "- **Example**: `mv file3.txt subdir2/` moves `file3.txt` to the `subdir2` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of Last Argument\n",
    "- When multiple sources are provided, the last argument is always interpreted as the target directory.\n",
    "- **Example**: `mv file1.txt file2.txt subdir2/` moves `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` into `subdir2/` because the last argument (`subdir2/`) is treated as the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursion Assumed for `mv` but Not for `cp`\n",
    "- `mv` assumes recursion when moving directories with contents, allowing you to move a directory without additional flags.\n",
    "  - **Example**: `mv subdir1/nested_dir subdir2/` moves the entire `nested_dir` with its contents to `subdir2/`.\n",
    "- `cp` requires the `-r` or `-R` flag for recursion. Without `-r`, copying a directory will result in an error.\n",
    "  - **Example**: `cp -r subdir2/nested_dir subdir1/` copies the entire `nested_dir` with its contents back to `subdir1/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Commands Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`mv`**:\n",
    "  - Moves files or directories from one location to another.\n",
    "  - Recursively moves directories by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`cp`**:\n",
    "  - Copies files from one location to another.\n",
    "  - Requires `-r` or `-R` for copying directories and their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ls`**:\n",
    "  - Lists the contents of directories to verify file operations.\n"

    "- **Command:** `ln original_file.txt hard_link.txt`\n",
    "  \n",
    "A hard link is essentially another name for the same file. Both the original file and the hard link share the same inode number.\n",
    "- Changes made to the hard link reflect in the original file and vice versa.\n",
    "- If you delete the original file, the hard link remains and retains the file content.\n",

    "### Creating Symbolic (Soft) Links\n",
    "- **Command:** `ln -s original_file.txt soft_link.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "A symbolic (soft) link acts as a pointer to the original file and does not share the inode number of the original file.\n",
    "- If you delete the original file, the symbolic link becomes a \"broken link\" and no longer functions.\n",
    "- Symbolic links are displayed with an arrow (`->`) pointing to the target file when using `ls -l`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifying Links\n",
    "- **Commands:** `ls -li` and `cat <filename>`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The `-i` option displays inode numbers, allowing verification that hard links share the same inode number while symbolic links do not.\n",
    "  - Displaying file contents with `cat` shows that changes made to the hard link affect the original file. The symbolic link, however, depends on the presence of the original file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of Deleting the Original File\n",
    "After deleting the original file with `rm original_file.txt`:\n",
    "- **Hard Link:** The hard link continues to exist because it shares the inode with the original file.\n",

    "## Explanation of Each Command\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring `/proc` Filesystem\n",
    "The `/proc` directory is a virtual filesystem that provides information about the kernel, system, and running processes. The contents here are not traditional files but rather kernel-generated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key files and directories in `/proc`:\n",
    "- **`/proc/cpuinfo`**: Displays detailed information about the CPUs on the system.\n",
    "- **`/proc/meminfo`**: Shows memory-related information, including total, free, and cached memory.\n",
    "- **`/proc/version`**: Displays the Linux kernel version.\n",
    "- **`/proc/uptime`**: Shows the system's uptime in seconds.\n",
    "- **`/proc/[PID]`**: Each subdirectory corresponds to a running process identified by its Process ID (PID).\n",
    "- **`/proc/partitions`**: Provides partition information.\n",
    "- **`/proc/mounts`**: Lists all mounted filesystems and their properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring `/sys` Filesystem\n",
    "The `/sys` directory is another virtual filesystem, primarily used to provide information about devices, kernel modules, and hardware attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common subdirectories in `/sys`:\n",
    "- **`/sys/class`**: Represents different classes of devices, such as CPU, network interfaces (`net`), and block devices.\n",
    "- **`/sys/devices`**: Provides detailed information about devices connected to the system.\n",
    "- **`/sys/block`**: Lists block devices (e.g., storage devices).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Hardware and Device Information\n",
    "- **`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*`**: Lists all CPUs present on the system.\n",
    "- **`/sys/block/sda`**: Represents a block device, such as a hard disk or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Information on Processes\n",
    "Each process on the system has a corresponding directory in `/proc`, named by its PID.\n",
    "- Files such as `status`, `cmdline`, and `stat` in each process directory provide information about the process, including command-line arguments, memory usage, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-memory Filesystems\n",
    "- **`/proc` and `/sys`** are virtual filesystems existing in memory. They do not consume actual disk space and are used by the kernel to expose information and configuration options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role of `/proc`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Primarily provides information about the kernel, system resources, and running processes.\n",
    "- **Read-only**: Modifications in `/proc` do not persist across reboots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role of `/sys`\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Offers a structured view of kernel modules, devices, and hardware attributes.\n",
    "- **Functionality**: Allows interaction with hardware settings, such as changing CPU frequency.\n"
