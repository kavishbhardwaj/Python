The context to know this is very important as the Linux OS is derived from Unix OS. The Unix OS was developer in 1970s, keeping in mind that a single system needs to be accessed by multiple users, or can be grouped as well, either parallely or sequentially on a time-shared basis. This is very similar to how our modern-day clouds and servers work. It is one of the reasons why Linux is used in these particular systems most of the time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pQGpe8CllMcD"},"source":["## Understanding File Permissions\n","\n","In Linux, file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file.

Changing File Permissions: To make a script executable for everyone, you could use:\n","\n","```\n","sudo chmod 755 myscript.sh\n","```\n","\n","This grants the user read, write, and execute permissions, while the group and others receive read and execute permissions.\n","\n","3. Installing Software: When installing software using a package manager like `apt`, you need administrative privileges:\n","\n","```\n","sudo apt install nginx\n","```\n","\n","This command installs the Nginx web server on the system.\n","\n","4. Editing System Configuration Files: To edit a configuration file in /etc, such as hosts, you can use:\n","\n","```\n","sudo nano /etc/hosts\n","```\n","\n","This opens the `hosts` file in the nano text editor with elevated permissions, allowing you to make necessary changes.\n","\n","5.
