    "### **Detailed Notes for Topics in the Pattern Matching - Part 02 Lecture (Including `grep` Commands and BRE/ERE Switches)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I will further enhance the notes for the **Pattern Matching - Part 02** lecture by incorporating details about common **`grep`** usage patterns, the default engine (BRE), and how to switch to the Extended Regular Expression (ERE) engine. This ensures we cover all key concepts, commands, and examples, including those you mentioned.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Using `grep` for Pattern Matching in Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **`grep` Command Overview**:\n",
    "   - **`grep`** stands for **Global Regular Expression Print**, and it is a powerful text searching tool used to find lines that match a given **pattern** in files or command output.\n",
    "   - By default, `grep` uses the **Basic Regular Expression (BRE)** engine for pattern matching. It supports a wide range of regex patterns and is commonly used for searching text within files or across the output of other commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic `grep` Syntax**:\n",
    "- The general syntax for the `grep` command is as follows:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   grep 'pattern' filename\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This command searches for the **pattern** in the specified **filename** and prints any lines that match.\n",
    "   - If no filename is specified, `grep` reads input from standard input (e.g., piped output from another command).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Basic Pattern Search in a File**:\n",
    "   - To search for a pattern in a file:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep 'Error' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This command searches for the word \"Error\" in **logfile.txt** and prints any lines containing the word \"Error\".\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Example: Case-Insensitive Search**:\n",
    "   - To perform a case-insensitive search (matching both uppercase and lowercase):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep -i 'error' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches lines containing \"error\", \"Error\", \"ERROR\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Using `grep` for File Searches**:\n",
    "   - `grep` is one of the most widely used commands for pattern searching in files. It is particularly useful for searching through logs, configurations, and other text-based files to quickly find relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity**:\n",
    "   - By default, `grep` is case-sensitive, meaning that \"Error\" and \"error\" would be treated as different strings. Using the `-i` flag ensures that case is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Using `grep` with Pipes for Command Chaining**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Using `grep` with Pipes**:\n",
    "   - The **pipe (`|`)** operator allows you to pass the output of one command as input to another. **`grep`** is frequently used in combination with other commands to filter their output.\n",
    "   - This allows for highly flexible workflows, where you can filter large datasets or command outputs in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Using `grep` with Piped Output**:\n",
    "   - To search for a pattern within the output of another command, use the pipe (`|`):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     command | grep 'pattern'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This pipes the output of **command** into **grep**, where **grep** searches for lines containing the **pattern**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Filtering `ls` Output**:\n",
    "   - To list files and search for a specific file:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ls -l | grep 'filename'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This pipes the output of the **`ls -l`** command into **grep**, searching for lines that contain \"filename\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example: Filtering Process List with `ps`**:\n",
    "   - To search for a running process named \"apache\" using **ps** and **grep**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ps aux | grep 'apache'\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This command searches for processes containing \"apache\" in the output of **ps aux**, which lists all running processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Why Use Pipes with `grep`**:\n",
    "   - Piping **grep** with other commands allows you to create dynamic filtering systems, especially useful for system administration tasks like monitoring processes, filtering logs, or managing file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Default Regex Engine: BRE (Basic Regular Expression)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Default Engine: BRE**:\n",
    "   - By default, **`grep`** uses the **Basic Regular Expression (BRE)** engine. BRE supports standard regex patterns but requires certain special characters to be escaped. For example, parentheses for grouping must be escaped as `\\(` and `\\)`, and alternation (`|`) also needs escaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Using BRE with Grouping**:\n",
    "   - To match either \"error\" or \"warning\" using **BRE**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep '\\(error\\|warning\\)' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - The parentheses and pipe must be escaped in **BRE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matching Digits in BRE**:\n",
    "   - To match any line that contains exactly three digits using BRE:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep '[0-9]\\{3\\}' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - In **BRE**, curly braces must be escaped to indicate repetitions, which is different from **ERE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Understanding BRE in `grep`**:\n",
    "   - BRE is a more restrictive regex engine, where many special characters must be escaped to function as part of the regex. Despite this limitation, it is widely used due to its simplicity and the fact that it is the default mode in **`grep`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Switching to ERE (Extended Regular Expression)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Switching to Extended Regular Expression (ERE)**:\n",
    "   - **Extended Regular Expression (ERE)** is a more powerful and flexible regex engine compared to BRE. In ERE, special characters such as `+`, `?`, and `|` do not require escaping.\n",
    "   - In **`grep`**, you can switch to the **ERE** engine by using either the **`-E`** flag or the **`egrep`** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Switching to ERE Using `-E`**:\n",
    "   - To search for either \"error\" or \"warning\" using **ERE**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep -E 'error|warning' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - In **ERE**, the parentheses and pipe do not need to be escaped, simplifying the regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `egrep` for ERE**:\n",
    "   - Another way to enable **ERE** in `grep` is by using **`egrep`** (which is shorthand for `grep -E`):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     egrep 'error|warning' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This is functionally identical to using `grep -E`, making the pattern more readable by avoiding unnecessary escapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Why Use ERE?**:\n",
    "   - **ERE** is typically easier to work with when writing complex regular expressions because it requires fewer escapes for special characters. It is highly recommended when dealing with more advanced regex patterns that include alternation, repetition, or grouping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **BRE vs. ERE**:\n",
    "   - The main difference between **BRE** and **ERE** is how they handle special characters. **BRE** requires more escaping, while **ERE** provides a simpler and more intuitive syntax for regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Practical Use of `grep` with Regex**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Filtering Text in Files**:\n",
    "   - `grep` is frequently used to search for patterns in log files, configuration files, and other text-based documents. By combining **grep** with regex engines (BRE or ERE), you can quickly filter and extract useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command-Line Integration**:\n",
    "   - Combining `grep` with other command-line tools (e.g., `cut`, `awk`, `sed`) enhances its functionality. You can search for patterns, extract specific fields, and manipulate the output all in one command.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Searching for Error Messages in a Log File**:\n",
    "   - To search for lines containing \"error\" or \"failed\" using ERE:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep -E 'error|failed' logfile.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This helps in quickly identifying issues in a system log.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Extracting Specific Fields with `grep` and `cut`**:\n",
    "   - To search for a pattern in a file and extract a specific column (e.g., user names from a process list):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ps aux | grep 'apache' | cut -d ' ' -f 1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This command first filters processes with \"apache\", and then extracts the first field (username) using **cut**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Regex in System Administration**:\n",
    "   - The combination of **`grep`**, **regex**, and command-line tools is extremely powerful in system administration. It allows administrators to monitor system logs, process data, and troubleshoot issues efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choosing Between BRE and ERE**:\n",
    "   - For simple patterns, **BRE** (the default) is sufficient. However, for more complex regex patterns, it is recommended to switch to **ERE** for easier syntax and fewer escapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Detailed Notes for Special Characters, Character Classes in BRE/ERE Regular Expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will provide a detailed breakdown of **special characters** used in **Basic Regular Expression (BRE)** and **Extended Regular Expression (ERE)** engines, as well as the different **character classes** that are available. These elements are foundational for building complex and effective regular expressions.\n",

    "### **1. Special Characters (BRE & ERE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Special characters** in regular expressions provide advanced functionality by allowing patterns to match a variety of characters or positions within strings. These characters serve various roles such as representing any character, defining ranges, matching at the start or end of a line, and escaping other special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Special Characters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`.` (dot)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: Matches **any single character** except null (`\\0`) or newline (`\\n`).\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`h.t`** will match \"hat\", \"hot\", or \"hit\", but it won’t match \"heat\" or \"ht\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`*` (asterisk)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: Matches **zero or more occurrences** of the preceding character or expression.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`a*`** will match \"\", \"a\", \"aa\", or \"aaa\", meaning any string with zero or more occurrences of the character \"a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`[]` (square brackets)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: Matches **any one of the enclosed characters**. A **hyphen (`-`)** between two characters indicates a range.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`[a-z]`** will match any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\".\n",
    "     - The pattern **`[0-9]`** will match any single digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`^` (caret)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: When placed at the beginning of a pattern, it **anchors the pattern to the start of the line**. Inside square brackets, it **negates** the enclosed characters.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`^Error`** will match any line that begins with \"Error\".\n",
    "     - The pattern **`[^a-z]`** will match any character **except** lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`$` (dollar sign)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: Anchors the pattern to the **end of a line**.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`end$`** will match any line that ends with the word \"end\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`\\` (backslash)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: Used to **escape special characters** so they are treated as literal characters rather than having their special meaning.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`\\.`** will match a literal period (.) rather than any character.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Matching Any Single Character**:\n",
    "   - To match any single character except newline:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep 'h.t' file.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match \"hot\", \"hat\", or \"hit\" in the file.\n",

    "2. **Matching Zero or More Occurrences**:\n",
    "   - To match zero or more occurrences of \"a\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep 'a*' file.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match \"\", \"a\", \"aa\", etc.\n",

    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`a\\{2,5\\}`** matches \"aa\", \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", or \"aaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`\\(` and `\\)` (escaped parentheses)**:\n",
    "   - **Grouping**: These parentheses are used to **group expressions** or characters, allowing you to apply quantifiers to the entire group.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`\\([0-9]\\{3\\}\\)`** groups three digits together.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **BRE requires more escaping** than ERE, making it more cumbersome when working with complex regular expressions. However, it remains useful for simpler patterns and in systems that default to **BRE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Special Characters (ERE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Key ERE-Specific Special Characters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`{n,m}`**:\n",
    "   - Similar to BRE, this matches the **preceding character or pattern at least `n` times and at most `m` times**, but without needing to escape the curly braces.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`a{2,5}`** matches \"aa\", \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", or \"aaaaa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`(` and `)` (parentheses)**:\n",
    "   - **Grouping**: Used for grouping expressions or characters, similar to BRE but without needing to escape them.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`([0-9]{3})`** groups three digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`+` (plus)**:\n",
    "   - Matches **one or more** occurrences of the preceding character or expression.\n",

    "### **Detailed Notes for Backreferences, BRE/ERE Operator Precedence**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will cover detailed notes on **backreferences** and the **operator precedence** in both **Basic Regular Expressions (BRE)** and **Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)**. These concepts are crucial for understanding how regular expressions interpret and execute complex patterns involving subexpressions, backreferences, and repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Backreferences**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Backreferences** refer to the ability to reference previously matched subexpressions in a regular expression. This feature allows for powerful pattern matching by repeating parts of a pattern without explicitly writing them out again.\n",
    "- Backreferences are particularly useful for matching **repeated occurrences** of patterns within the same line or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backreferences (`\\1` through `\\9`)**:\n",
    "   - **BRE/ERE**: The notation **`\\1`**, **`\\2`**, ..., **`\\9`** refers to **backreferences**. Each number refers to the **nth parenthesized subexpression** in the regex.\n",
    "   - **`\\n`** matches whatever was matched by the **nth earlier parenthesized subexpression**. For instance, **`\\1`** refers to the first parenthesized subexpression, **`\\2`** refers to the second, and so on.\n",
    "   - The backreference feature makes it possible to enforce patterns where certain parts of a string must repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example: Matching Two Occurrences of \"hello\"**:\n",
    "   - To match a line that contains the word \"hello\" twice, the following **BRE** regex is used:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\(hello\\).*\\1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - **Explanation**:\n",
    "       - **`\\(` and `\\)`** are used to group the word \"hello\".\n",
    "       - **`\\1`** refers to the first occurrence of the word \"hello\".\n",
    "       - The **`.*`** in between allows any number of characters between the two occurrences of \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Matching Repeated Digits**:\n",
    "   - To match a line with two identical digits (like \"55\" or \"22\"):\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\([0-9]\\)\\1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - **Explanation**:\n",
    "       - **`\\([0-9]\\)`** captures a digit.\n",
    "       - **`\\1`** matches the same digit again, so the pattern matches repeated digits like \"11\", \"22\", \"33\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example: Using Backreferences in ERE**:\n",
    "   - In **ERE**, you can achieve the same result with simplified parentheses:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     (hello).*\\1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Why Use Backreferences**:\n",
    "   - Backreferences are useful in scenarios where repeated patterns are required, such as validating duplicated words, checking for symmetrical structures, or ensuring consistent formatting.\n",
    "   - They eliminate the need to rewrite the same pattern multiple times, making regex more efficient and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. BRE Operator Precedence**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Operator precedence** defines the order in which regular expression operators are applied. Understanding operator precedence is important for constructing accurate and efficient regex patterns. In **BRE**, the precedence determines how different operators like repetition, concatenation, and anchors interact in a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **BRE Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`[..] [==] [::]` (Character Collation)**:\n",
    "   - **Character collation** refers to matching specific ranges or categories of characters using brackets, equivalence classes `[==]`, or character classes `[::]`.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter from \"a\" to \"z\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`\\metachar` (Escape Sequences)**:\n",
    "   - Escape sequences like **`\\n`** (newline) and **`\\t`** (tab) have high precedence.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`\\t`** matches a tab character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`[ ]` (Bracket Expansion)**:\n",
    "   - **Bracket expansion** matches any character listed inside the square brackets. It also handles ranges like `[a-z]` or `[0-9]`.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - `[aeiou]` matches any of the vowels \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", or \"u\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`\\(`, `\\)` (Grouping) and `\\n` (Backreferences)**:\n",
    "   - Parentheses **`\\(` and `\\)`** are used for grouping, while **`\\n`** refers to backreferences.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`\\([A-Z]\\)\\1`** matches two identical uppercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`* \\{ \\}` (Repetition)**:\n",
    "   - The asterisk (`*`) matches zero or more occurrences, and **`\\{n,m\\}`** specifies a range for the number of repetitions.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`a*`** matches zero or more \"a\"s.\n",
    "     - **`a\\{2,5\\}`** matches between 2 and 5 occurrences of \"a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concatenation**:\n",
    "   - **Concatenation** refers to matching patterns in sequence.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - The pattern **`abc`** matches the string \"abc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`^` and `$` (Anchors)**:\n",
    "   - Anchors **`^`** and **`$`** match the beginning and end of a line, respectively.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`^Start`** matches lines beginning with \"Start\".\n",
    "     - **`End$`** matches lines ending with \"End\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Operator Precedence in BRE**:\n",
    "   - **Collation and bracket expansion** have the highest precedence, followed by **grouping** and **backreferences**. This hierarchy ensures that the most specific matches (like character ranges) are applied before broader operations like repetition or concatenation.\n",
    "   - Understanding precedence is crucial for avoiding unintended matches and writing efficient regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. ERE Operator Precedence**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Extended Regular Expression (ERE)** follows a slightly different operator precedence than BRE, with additional operators like `+` and `?`. The precedence in ERE determines how these operators are interpreted and combined to form complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ERE Operator Precedence (Highest to Lowest)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`[..] [==] [::]` (Character Collation)**:\n",
    "   - Just like BRE, **character collation** has the highest precedence. It refers to matching specific ranges or character classes.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`\\metachar` (Escape Sequences)**:\n",
    "   - Escape sequences, like **`\\n`** for newline or **`\\t`** for tab, also have high precedence in ERE.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`\\n`** matches a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`[ ]` (Bracket Expansion)**:\n",
    "   - **Bracket expansion** allows for matching characters in a set or range.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - `[0-9]` matches any digit from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`( )` (Grouping)**:\n",
    "   - Grouping is achieved using parentheses in ERE without needing to escape them.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`(cat|dog)`** matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`* + ? { }` (Repetition)**:\n",
    "   - Repetition operators, like **`*`** (zero or more), **`+`** (one or more), **`?`** (zero or one), and **`{n,m}`** (range) have a lower precedence than grouping but still take precedence over concatenation.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`a+`** matches one or more occurrences of \"a\".\n",
    "     - **`b{2,4}`** matches between 2 and 4 occurrences of \"b\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concatenation**:\n",
    "   - Just like BRE, **concatenation** matches patterns in sequence.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`abc`** matches the string \"abc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **`^` and `$` (Anchors)**:\n",
    "   - **Anchors** still have the lowest precedence, used to mark the start or end of a line.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`^Start`** matches lines that begin with \"Start\".\n",
    "     - **`End$`** matches lines that end with \"End\".\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **`|` (Alternation)**:\n",
    "   - In ERE, alternation (`|`) has the lowest precedence, matching either one pattern or another.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     - **`cat|dog`** matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Operator Precedence in ERE**:\n",
    "   - **Collation** and **escape sequences** are still given the highest precedence, but ERE introduces more operators like **`+`**, **`?`**, and **alternation (`|`)**. This precedence ensures that repetition and grouping are handled before alternation and concatenation.\n",
    "   - ERE provides a more intuitive way to handle complex patterns because it does not require escaping for grouping and alternation, making it easier to build and read regex patterns.\n",
