    "\n",
    "### What is `ed`?\n",
    "- **`ed` is a text editor** that operates entirely within the **terminal**. It's one of the oldest text editors designed for Unix systems and is very basic compared to modern editors.\n",
    "- Unlike modern editors like **Notepad** or **VS Code**, **`ed`** doesn’t show the content of the file as you type. Instead, it waits for specific commands to insert, edit, or view the text.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### How does `ed` differ from the terminal?\n",
    "- **The terminal** is the interface you’re working in—it's a command-line interface (CLI) where you type commands to interact with your system (such as running programs, editing files, etc.).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`ed` is a program** that runs *inside* the terminal. When you open `ed`, you’re still in the terminal, but now you’re running a program (just like opening a web browser or text editor on your computer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key differences:\n",
    "1. **Terminal**: This is the tool you’re using to interact with your system. You type commands like `ls` to list files, `cd` to change directories, etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`ed`**: This is a program you can run *inside* the terminal to edit text files. It's like a super-basic version of Notepad but without the user-friendly interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow in the terminal:\n",
    "1. You open the terminal and type commands to interact with the system.\n",
    "2. When you type `ed testfile.txt`, you’re telling the terminal to open the **`ed` text editor** with the file named `testfile.txt`.\n",
    "3. Once inside `ed`, you use special commands (like `a` to add text, `p` to print text, etc.) to interact with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of how `ed` works in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the terminal** and type:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ed testfile.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This opens the file `testfile.txt` in the `ed` editor (in the terminal window).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Type commands in `ed`** to modify the file:\n",
    "   - To add text: Type `a`, then type your lines, and end with a `.`.\n",
    "   - To print the content of the file: Type `,p`.\n",
    "   - To save the file: Type `w`.\n",
    "   - To quit `ed`: Type `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're **in `ed`**, you're still inside the terminal, but you're running the **`ed` text editor** to interact with a file.\n"
