It allows you to access remote machines over a network securely.\n","\n","### Key Features of SSH:\n","- **Encryption**: SSH encrypts the data being transmitted, ensuring confidentiality.\n","- **Authentication**: You can use passwords or key pairs for secure authentication.\n","- **Integrity**: SSH ensures that the data has not been altered during transmission."],"metadata":{"id":"AdXR1bzMjTyq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Why Use SSH?\n","\n","1. **Secure Remote Access**: Manage servers and systems from anywhere.\n","2. **Secure File Transfer**: Transfer files securely using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).\n","3. **Tunneling**: Forward ports securely to protect your data."],"metadata":{"id":"9SqrmomhjYvY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Basic SSH Command Syntax\n","\n","The basic syntax of the SSH command is:\n","\n","```bash\n","ssh [user]@[hostname]\n","```\n","\n","**Parameters**\n","\n","* **user**: The username on the remote system.\n","* **hostname**: The IP address or domain name of the remote system."],"metadata":{"id":"QvHIJfgCjbvQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## How to Use SSH\n","\n","1.
