    "### **Detailed Notes for Topics 1 to 4 from the Pattern Matching Lecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I will provide detailed notes for topics 1 through 4 of the **Pattern Matching - Part 01** lecture. I will ensure that all concepts, commands, and examples from the lecture are included, along with additional insights to clarify and expand on the ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to Pattern Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **What is Pattern Matching?**\n",
    "   - **Pattern matching** refers to searching for and identifying specific sequences of characters (patterns) within a text. This is done using **regular expressions** (also called **regex**).\n",
    "   - Regular expressions are a powerful tool in programming and text processing that allow users to specify complex search patterns using symbols and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Regular Expressions**:\n",
    "   - A regular expression (regex) consists of **literals** (exact characters) and **special symbols** that define search patterns.\n",
    "   - Basic pattern matching includes finding specific characters in a string. For instance, the pattern **`a`** will match all occurrences of the character \"a\" in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Simple Character Matching**:\n",
    "   - Example: To match all lines containing the letter \"M\" in a text:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     M\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This pattern will match any occurrence of the capital letter \"M\" in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Combination of Multiple Characters**:\n",
    "   - If you want to search for lines containing both \"M\" and \"E\", the regex would be:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     M.*E\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - The `.*` symbol represents **any sequence of characters** (including no characters), so this pattern will match any string that contains an \"M\" followed by any number of characters, and then an \"E\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **The Importance of Regex**:\n",
    "   - Regular expressions provide a way to perform complex searches that are difficult or impossible with simple string searches. Regex is used in many fields, including data extraction, validation, and text manipulation.\n",
    "   - Even basic patterns can be extremely useful for finding specific information in large files, such as logs or data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Symbols in Regex**:\n",
    "   - It’s important to become familiar with basic regex symbols:\n",
    "     - **`.` (dot)**: Matches any single character except for a newline.\n",
    "     - **`*`**: Matches 0 or more of the preceding character.\n",
    "     - **`+`**: Matches 1 or more of the preceding character.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Case-Sensitive and Case-Insensitive Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Case-Sensitive Matching**:\n",
    "   - By default, regular expressions in most programming languages and tools (like **grep** in Linux) are case-sensitive. This means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as different characters.\n",
    "   - For example, the pattern **`M`** matches uppercase \"M\", but it won’t match lowercase \"m\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case-Insensitive Matching**:\n",
    "   - Case-insensitive matching allows you to ignore the case when performing a pattern match. This is useful when you want to match letters regardless of whether they are uppercase or lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - To perform a case-insensitive match in **grep**, you can use the **`-i`** flag:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep -i \"m\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match both \"m\" and \"M\" in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Case-Sensitive Matching Example**:\n",
    "   - Suppose we have a text with the following lines:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Mechanical Engineering\n",
    "     Music Media\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - The regex **`M`** will match only the lines containing the capital \"M\", such as:\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       Mechanical Engineering\n",
    "       Music Media\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Case-Insensitive Matching Example**:\n",
    "   - Using the case-insensitive flag:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     grep -i \"m\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match any occurrence of \"m\", whether uppercase or lowercase. It would match both \"Mechanical\" and \"music\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **When to Use Case Sensitivity**:\n",
    "   - In many cases, it’s useful to ignore case sensitivity, especially when searching for names, addresses, or words that may be written inconsistently. Using the `-i` option in tools like **grep** or specifying case insensitivity in regex helps ensure broader matches.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Using Case Sensitivity for Precision**:\n",
    "   - On the other hand, sometimes case sensitivity is important, particularly when distinguishing between different types of data (e.g., \"ME\" for Mechanical Engineering, \"me\" for something else). Be mindful of when case matters and when it doesn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Word Boundaries and Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Word Boundaries**:\n",
    "   - In regular expressions, a **word boundary** is represented by **`\\b`**. It indicates the boundary between a word character and a non-word character.\n",
    "   - Word boundaries are useful when you want to match whole words, rather than substrings within words. For instance, matching the word \"cat\" without matching \"scatter\" or \"catalog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using `\\b` for Exact Word Matches**:\n",
    "   - **`\\b`** ensures that a pattern only matches at the beginning or end of a word, depending on where it is placed in the regex.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - **`\\bam\\b`**: This matches \"am\" only if it appears as a standalone word (with spaces or punctuation around it).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Matching Word Boundaries**:\n",
    "   - Suppose we have the following lines of text:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     I am a student.\n",
    "     Ram went to the market.\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - The regex **`\\bam\\b`** will match only the word \"am\" in the first line, while ignoring \"Ram\" in the second line because \"am\" is part of a larger word there.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Word Boundaries to Match Substrings**:\n",
    "   - To match the word \"am\" at the end of a word, we can use:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\bam\\b\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match only occurrences where \"am\" is a complete word. It won’t match \"Ram\" or \"Sam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Why Word Boundaries Matter**:\n",
    "   - Word boundaries are critical when you want to ensure precision in your searches. For instance, searching for \"in\" without boundaries will also match words like \"inside\" and \"inline\". By using word boundaries, you ensure that only full words are matched.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Practical Use of Word Boundaries**:\n",
    "   - Word boundaries are particularly useful in natural language processing, where exact word matches are needed to extract data from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Repetitions and Grouping Characters**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Repetitions in Regex**:\n",
    "   - Regex allows you to match repeated occurrences of patterns using **quantifiers**:\n",
    "     - **`*`**: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "     - **`+`**: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "     - **`?`**: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping Characters with Parentheses `()`**:\n",
    "   - You can group characters or patterns together using parentheses to apply quantifiers to entire groups.\n",
    "   - For example, **`(ma)`** will treat \"ma\" as a single unit, allowing you to apply quantifiers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Using `*` to Match Zero or More Occurrences**:\n",
    "   - The pattern **`ma*`** will match the character \"m\" followed by zero or more occurrences of \"a\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ma*\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This would match \"m\", \"ma\", \"maa\", \"maaaa\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Using Grouping with Parentheses**:\n",
    "   - To match the string \"ma\" followed by any characters, but repeated, you can use:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     (ma)+\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match one or more occurrences of \"ma\", such as \"ma\", \"mama\", \"mamama\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Power of Quantifiers**:\n",
    "   - Quantifiers allow for more flexibility when searching for patterns that may appear multiple times in different contexts. This is especially useful in data extraction where patterns can vary slightly but follow a general rule.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Grouping in Regex**:\n",
    "   - Grouping is an essential part of building complex regex patterns. By grouping characters, you can apply quantifiers or other rules to entire sequences, making your regex more efficient and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **5. Alternation and Pipe (OR) Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Alternation with the Pipe (`|`) Operator**:\n",
    "   - The **pipe (`|`)** operator allows for **alternation** in regular expressions, which means matching one pattern or another. It acts as a logical OR between different patterns.\n",
    "   - For example, if you want to match either \"cat\" or \"dog,\" you can use the regex:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     cat|dog\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches either \"cat\" or \"dog\" in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Parentheses with Alternation**:\n",
    "   - To apply alternation within specific parts of a pattern, you can group patterns using parentheses. This allows for more complex alternations where you need to match multiple parts of a string with different alternatives.\n",
    "   - For example, matching \"Mechanical\" or \"ME\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     (Mechanical|ME)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Basic Alternation**:\n",
    "   - To match lines containing either \"Mechanical\" or \"ME,\" the regex would be:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Mechanical|ME\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This pattern will match any occurrence of either \"Mechanical\" or \"ME\" in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Using Parentheses for Grouping**:\n",
    "   - If we want to match the entire string \"Mechanical Engineering\" or just \"ME,\" we can group the alternation:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     (Mechanical Engineering|ME)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This regex matches either the entire string \"Mechanical Engineering\" or just \"ME\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **When to Use Alternation**:\n",
    "   - Alternation is particularly useful when you need to search for multiple related patterns. For instance, you may want to find either of two spellings of a name or search for terms that are used interchangeably in a document (like \"colour\" and \"color\").\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Combining Alternation with Grouping**:\n",
    "   - Grouping with parentheses ensures that the alternation is applied only to the specific part of the pattern where you need alternatives. This makes regex patterns more flexible and powerful, especially when dealing with complex text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Combining Patterns with Anchors**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Anchors in Regular Expressions**:\n",
    "   - **Anchors** are special characters in regex that match specific positions in a string rather than actual characters. They help define where a pattern must appear within the string:\n",
    "     - **`^` (caret)**: Matches the start of a line or string.\n",
    "     - **`$` (dollar sign)**: Matches the end of a line or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matching Patterns at the Start or End of Strings**:\n",
    "   - Anchors are often used to ensure that a pattern appears at the beginning or end of a line. For example:\n",
    "     - **`^cat`** matches \"cat\" only if it appears at the start of the line.\n",
    "     - **`dog$`** matches \"dog\" only if it appears at the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Anchors with Other Regex Features**:\n",
    "   - Anchors can be combined with other regular expression symbols to create complex patterns. For instance, you can use an anchor to match a specific word at the start of the line, followed by another pattern in the middle of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Matching at the Start of a Line**:\n",
    "   - To match lines that start with the word \"Hello\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ^Hello\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match any line that begins with the word \"Hello,\" but it won’t match \"say Hello\" because \"Hello\" isn’t at the start of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Matching at the End of a Line**:\n",
    "   - To match lines that end with the word \"goodbye\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     goodbye$\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This will match any line where \"goodbye\" appears at the end. It won’t match \"goodbye world\" because \"goodbye\" isn’t the last word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example: Combining Anchors with Other Patterns**:\n",
    "   - To match lines that start with \"Error\" and end with \"failed\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ^Error.*failed$\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches lines that begin with \"Error\" and end with \"failed\", with any number of characters (denoted by `.*`) in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Why Anchors Are Important**:\n",
    "   - Anchors are useful when you need precision in pattern matching. For example, when parsing log files, you may only want to match lines where a certain error code appears at the beginning or where specific words appear at the end of a sentence.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Combining Anchors with Other Regex Features**:\n",
    "   - Anchors become powerful when combined with other regex symbols. You can build patterns that match exact positions in text, ensuring you get the correct results even in complex data sets.\n",

    "### **7. Special Characters and Groups in Regex**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concepts Covered**:\n",
    "- **Special Characters in Regex**:\n",
    "   - Regular expressions use **special characters** to represent abstract concepts. These characters help define more advanced search patterns.\n",
    "     - **`.` (dot)**: Matches any single character except a newline.\n",
    "     - **`\\d`**: Matches any digit.\n",
    "     - **`\\w`**: Matches any word character (letters, digits, or underscores).\n",
    "     - **`\\s`**: Matches any whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping with Parentheses**:\n",
    "   - Parentheses `()` are used to group parts of a pattern together, allowing you to treat them as a single unit. This is especially useful when applying quantifiers or alternation to multiple characters at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capturing Groups**:\n",
    "   - When you use parentheses, the matched portion of the string is captured and can be referenced later. This is known as a **capturing group**.\n",
    "   - Capturing groups are useful in cases where you want to extract part of the matched pattern or use it again later in your regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Commands/Examples**:\n",
    "1. **Example: Using the Dot `.` to Match Any Character**:\n",
    "   - The regex:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     h.t\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches \"hat\", \"hot\", \"hit\", and any other three-character string that starts with \"h\", ends with \"t\", and has any character in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example: Matching Digits with `\\d`**:\n",
    "   - The regex:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\d\\d\\d\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches any three-digit number, such as \"123\" or \"456\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example: Grouping and Capturing with Parentheses**:\n",
    "   - To capture the area code in a phone number like \"(123) 456-7890\":\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\((\\d{3})\\) \\d{3}-\\d{4}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This regex matches a phone number and captures the area code (the part inside the parentheses). The captured group can be referenced later or extracted for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example: Using `\\w` to Match Word Characters**:\n",
    "   - The regex:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \\w+\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This matches any sequence of word characters, which includes letters, digits, and underscores. For example, it will match \"hello\", \"1234\", or \"variable_name\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Insights**:\n",
    "- **Understanding Special Characters**:\n",
    "   - Special characters like **`.`**, **`\\d`**, and **`\\w`** make regular expressions more versatile, allowing them to match complex patterns in text. These are essential for matching broad classes of characters rather than specific ones.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Capturing Groups in Practice**:\n",
    "   - Capturing groups are especially powerful when you need to extract parts of a matched pattern. For instance, when processing a text document, you might need to extract phone numbers or email addresses from a large block of text.\n",
