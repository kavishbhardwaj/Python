    "A shell is a program that provides an interface between you (the user) and the operating system (like Windows, Linux, or macOS). Think of it like a translator that helps you communicate with your computer using commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of shells:\n",
    "\n",
    "Command Prompt: The default shell for Windows.\n",
    "PowerShell: An advanced shell with more capabilities, also for Windows.\n",
    "Bash (Bourne Again Shell): A popular shell for Linux and macOS systems.\n",
    "Git Bash is a shell environment for Windows that provides Bash (the Linux-style shell) and integrates it with some additional features from Git.\n",
    "Bash on Windows: Normally, Windows uses Command Prompt or PowerShell, but Bash is a popular shell used on Linux systems. Git Bash brings the Bash shell to Windows, so you can use Linux-like commands (ls, pwd, rm, etc.) on your Windows system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bash shell is like a command prompt but with commands similar to those used on Linux. Since we're using Git Bash and MinGW, these commands will behave like we're in a Linux-like environment on our Windows system. Git Bash is installed on Windows as a separate terminal program.\n",
    "It uses MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) as its backend, which provides the necessary tools and libraries to mimic a Linux environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "%%bash\n",
    "This command is specific to Jupyter notebooks and tells the notebook to run the following commands in a bash shell.\n",
    "The %%bash is called a cell magic command. It allows you to run bash shell commands directly in a code cell. This means that any commands you write in that cell will be executed as if they were typed in a bash shell, instead of being interpreted as Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few common commands you can use in Git Bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "ls – Lists files and directories in the current directory.\n",
    "pwd – Prints the current directory path.\n",
    "cd <directory> – Changes to a different directory.\n",
    "touch <filename> – Creates an empty file.\n",
    "rm <filename> – Deletes a file.\n",
    "git status – Shows the current status of your Git repository.\n",
    "git clone <url> – Clones a Git repository from a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Not Just Use Python Code?\n",
    "Using bash commands is simpler and more efficient than using Python code, especially when interacting with the operating system. For example:\n",
    "File System Operations: ls, pwd, cd, rm are simpler than their Python equivalents (os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), os.remove()).\n",
    "Version Control: Managing Git commands is easier using shell commands (git status, git commit, etc.) rather than using Python libraries like subprocess.\n",
    "Package Management: Installing packages with pip or conda is easier in bash than using subprocess or Python methods."

    "1. **Permissions**: (`drwxr-xr-x`)\n",
    "   - This shows the file permissions for the owner, group, and others.\n",
    "   - first letter -  `d` indicates a **directory** (if it were a file, it would be `-`).\n",
    "                     'l' indicates symbolic link (shortcut)\n",
    "                     '-' indicates file\n",

    "                     'b' block devices (hard discs)\n",
    "   - next three for owner - `rwx` means **read, write, and execute** permissions for the owner.\n",

    "   - next three for others- `r-x` means **read and execute** permissions for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Links**: (`1`)\n",
    "   - The number of links or directories inside this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Owner**: (`kavis`)\n",
    "   - The username of the owner of the file or directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Group**: (`197609`)\n",
    "   - The group ID associated with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Size**: (`0`, `40`, `12288`, etc.)\n",
    "   - The size of the file in bytes. For directories, it’s usually `0` since it doesn’t directly reflect the size of contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Timestamp**: (`Oct 6 14:21`)\n",
    "   - The date and time when the file or directory was last modified.\n",

    "7. **File/Directory Name**: (`$Recycle.Bin`, `Documents and Settings`, etc.)\n",
    "   - The name of the file or directory.\n",

    "#### Listing Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Documents and Settings -> /c/Users`**:\n",
    "   - This is a **symbolic link** (shortcut) that points to `/c/Users`. It means that trying to access `Documents and Settings` will actually redirect you to the `/c/Users` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Drivers`**:\n",
    "   - Likely a folder containing drivers for the system. Drivers are software that help the operating system communicate with hardware devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Program Files`** and **`Program Files (x86)`**:\n",
    "   - Standard directories in Windows for installing 64-bit and 32-bit applications, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`ProgramData`**:\n",
    "   - A directory used to store application data that is not specific to a user. It’s shared among all users of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Users`**:\n",
    "    - This is where user profiles are stored on Windows, such as `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`, and so on for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Windows`**:\n",
    "    - The main directory containing the Windows operating system files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`hiberfil.sys`**:\n",
    "    - A **system file** used by Windows to store the system state when it goes into **hibernation**. This file is often large and contains everything stored in memory (RAM)."
