    "### Detailed Explanation of the First Two Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll take a deep dive into the first two commands from the list, breaking them down into easy-to-understand concepts, examples from the lecture, and additional explanations. By the end of this, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how these commands function and how they can be used effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Command: `command 2> file1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command redirects **standard error** to `file1`. In Linux/Unix-like systems, the shell has three default streams:\n",
    "- **Standard Input (stdin)**: For receiving input.\n",
    "- **Standard Output (stdout)**: For displaying results or outputs of a command.\n",
    "- **Standard Error (stderr)**: For displaying error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, both the **standard output** and **standard error** are displayed on the terminal. However, using `2>` allows us to redirect the standard error to a file instead of showing it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept of File Descriptors:**\n",
    "- **1**: Refers to **standard output**.\n",
    "- **2**: Refers to **standard error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `2>` means \"send the error messages (standard error) to the specified file.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "Consider the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /nonexistentdirectory 2> errorfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, the `ls` command tries to list a non-existent directory, which would normally result in an error message shown on the screen.\n",
    "- Instead of showing the error on the screen, the command redirects it to `errorfile` using the `2>` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open `errorfile`, you will find the error message that says something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls: cannot access '/nonexistentdirectory': No such file or directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the error is captured in a file, which can be useful for debugging scripts or keeping logs of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Is This Useful?**\n",
    "There are several practical reasons why you might want to redirect errors to a file:\n",
    "- **Error Logging**: If you're running a script that processes a large number of files or performs operations that may fail, it’s useful to keep track of what went wrong by saving error messages in a file for review later.\n",
    "- **Cleaner Output**: Sometimes you want to see only the successful results of a command on your terminal. Redirecting errors to a file allows you to suppress them from the terminal output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "cat file_that_does_not_exist.txt 2> errors.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `cat` command tries to display the contents of `file_that_does_not_exist.txt`. Since the file doesn’t exist, the error message will be written to `errors.txt` instead of being displayed on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Command: `command > file1 2> file2`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command redirects both the **standard output** and the **standard error** to separate files. \n",
    "- `>` is used to redirect standard output to `file1`.\n",
    "- `2>` is used to redirect standard error to `file2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "When you execute a command, its output (if successful) will be sent to one file (`file1`), while any error messages will be sent to another file (`file2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "Let’s look at a practical example used in the lecture:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory > outputfile 2> errorfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`/existingdirectory`** is a directory that exists.\n",
    "- **`/nonexistentdirectory`** does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens:\n",
    "- The output of listing `/existingdirectory` (which is successful) will be written to `outputfile`.\n",
    "- The error message from trying to list `/nonexistentdirectory` will be written to `errorfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to capture both the successful output and any errors separately, which is useful for troubleshooting or logging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Explanation of File Overwriting:**\n",
    "It’s important to note that both `>` and `2>` **overwrite** the contents of the files if they already exist. So, if `outputfile` or `errorfile` contains any previous data, it will be lost when the command runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To **append** to the files (without overwriting), you can use `>>` instead of `>`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory >> outputfile 2>> errorfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This will append the new results to the existing contents of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "grep \"pattern\" myfile.txt > output.txt 2> error.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`> output.txt`**: The results of the `grep` command (if it finds the pattern) will be written to `output.txt`.\n",
    "- **`2> error.txt`**: If the file `myfile.txt` doesn’t exist, or there’s another error, the error message will be written to `error.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, you can separate successful results from error messages, making it easier to understand what happened when you review the files later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Use These Commands?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these redirection techniques are extremely useful in real-world scenarios:\n",
    "- **Error Handling in Scripts**: When writing shell scripts, you often want to track both successful operations and errors. For example, if your script processes hundreds of files, you may want to log successful operations in one file and errors in another.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Consider this script:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  for file in /directory/*; do\n",
    "      process_file \"$file\" > success.log 2> errors.log\n",
    "  done\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - In this case, all successful operations will be logged in `success.log`, while any errors (e.g., missing files or permission issues) will be logged in `errors.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaner Terminal Output**: In some cases, errors can clutter your terminal output, especially if you’re only interested in the successful results. Redirecting errors to a file helps keep your terminal clean and focused on the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Review**: In long-running processes, such as system backups or data processing jobs, having separate logs for errors and outputs helps when reviewing what went right and what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Class Examples Recap:**\n",
    "1. **`ls /nonexistentdirectory 2> errorfile`**: Redirects error messages to `errorfile`.\n",
    "2. **`ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory > outputfile 2> errorfile`**: Separates successful output and errors into different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples highlight the practical applications of redirection for both standard output and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The commands `command 2> file1` and `command > file1 2> file2` are foundational in shell scripting and command-line operations. They offer fine control over where the output and errors go, allowing for cleaner terminal usage, easier troubleshooting, and better logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the knowledge of these commands, you can effectively manage output and errors in your scripts and command-line tasks, making your workflow more efficient and organized."

    "### Detailed Explanation of the Next Two Shell Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will focus on the next two commands: `command < file1` and `command > file1 2>&1`. This will include a breakdown of concepts, explanations, and examples from the lecture, along with additional insights and examples to ensure clarity and comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Command: `command < file1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command redirects **standard input** from `file1`. The operator `<` is used to tell the command to take input from a file rather than waiting for input from the user via the keyboard or standard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, when you run a command, it expects input from the keyboard (stdin), but with the `<` operator, you can specify a file to provide that input instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "Normally, a command like `cat` reads input from the standard input (keyboard). However, you can instruct it to take input from a file using `<`. So instead of typing the data manually, the command reads it from the specified file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following example was used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sort < unsorted_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `sort` command sorts the lines of a file.\n",
    "- In this case, instead of passing the file directly (`sort unsorted_file.txt`), we use `<` to tell the shell that the input to the `sort` command is coming from `unsorted_file.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will read the contents of `unsorted_file.txt`, sort it, and then display the sorted output on the screen (standard output).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use `<`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You use `<` when a command expects input from the user, but you want to automate the process by feeding it input from a file. This is common in scripts or when dealing with large files that you don’t want to manually enter or paste into the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "wc -l < file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `wc -l` command counts the number of lines in a file.\n",
    "- In this example, instead of typing the file name directly as an argument (`wc -l file.txt`), we use `<` to feed `file.txt` as input to the `wc` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "Consider a script that processes data stored in multiple files. Instead of entering the file data manually every time, you can automate the script to take input from files using `<`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "while read line; do\n",
    "    echo \"Processing: $line\"\n",
    "done < input_file.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this script:\n",
    "- The `while read line` loop reads each line of `input_file.txt` and processes it. \n",
    "- Instead of manually typing each line, the script reads the file line-by-line using `< input_file.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `command < file1`:**\n",
    "- Redirects **standard input** from `file1` to the command.\n",
    "- Commonly used to automate input for commands that normally require user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Command: `command > file1 2>&1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command redirects both **standard output** and **standard error** to the same file, `file1`. The operator `2>&1` is key here, as it instructs the shell to send the **standard error** (file descriptor `2`) to the same place as the **standard output** (file descriptor `1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Breaking Down `2>&1`:**\n",
    "- **`>`**: Redirects the **standard output** to `file1`.\n",
    "- **`2>&1`**: Redirects the **standard error** to wherever the **standard output** is being redirected (in this case, `file1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that both successful output and error messages from the command will be written to the same file, `file1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following command was provided as an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory > output.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `ls` command is used to list files in directories.\n",
    "- **`/existingdirectory`** is a valid directory, so its contents will be listed.\n",
    "- **`/nonexistentdirectory`** is not a valid directory, so the command will generate an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case:\n",
    "- The contents of `/existingdirectory` (standard output) and the error message from `/nonexistentdirectory` (standard error) will both be written to `output.txt` because of the `2>&1` redirection.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining both the output and error in one file, you can easily review the command's success and failure in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Use `2>&1`?**\n",
    "There are several reasons to use this command:\n",
    "- **Simplified Logging**: When running commands or scripts, it's often helpful to have both the output and any error messages saved in the same log file. This makes it easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong.\n",
    "- **Cleaner Terminal**: If you don’t want to clutter your terminal with error messages but still want to review them later, you can use `2>&1` to capture both output and errors in one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ping google.com > ping_results.txt 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command sends packets to `google.com` to check connectivity.\n",
    "- Any successful pings (standard output) and any errors (such as network issues) will be written to `ping_results.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Important Consideration: Order of Redirection**\n",
    "It is important to note that the order of redirection matters. If you switch the order of `2>&1`, the result will not be the same. Let’s look at an example to clarify:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct usage**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  command > file1 2>&1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here, the standard output is first redirected to `file1`, and then the standard error is redirected to the same place as the standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect usage**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  command 2>&1 > file1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  In this case, standard error is first redirected to the terminal (since standard output is still the terminal), and then standard output is redirected to `file1`. The error message would appear on the screen, not in `file1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "Imagine you are running a backup script, and you want to log both the successful file copies and any errors (such as missing files or permission issues) in the same log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "backup_script.sh > backup.log 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Both the output (successful operations) and any errors (e.g., permission denied) will be logged to `backup.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `command > file1 2>&1`:**\n",
    "- Redirects both **standard output** and **standard error** to the same file.\n",
    "- Useful for logging both successes and errors in the same file.\n",
    "- Important to ensure the correct order of redirection (`command > file1 2>&1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "We’ve covered the next two commands in the sequence:\n",
    "1. **`command < file1`**: Redirects standard input from a file, automating input for commands that typically require user interaction.\n",
    "2. **`command > file1 2>&1`**: Redirects both standard output and standard error to the same file, simplifying logging and error tracking.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Command: `command1 | command2` (Pipe Operator)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "The pipe (`|`) operator in Linux/Unix allows the output of one command (`command1`) to be used as the input to another command (`command2`). Instead of writing the output of `command1` to a file or the terminal, it is directly fed into `command2` for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "The pipe operator creates a \"pipeline\" between two commands. This is particularly useful when you want to process or filter the output of one command through another command without creating intermediate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might want to get a list of files and then filter that list to find specific ones. Piping allows you to chain commands together to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following example was used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls $HOME | grep \"Documents\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The `ls $HOME` command lists all files and directories in the home folder.\n",
    "- The `grep \"Documents\"` command searches for the keyword \"Documents\" in the output of `ls $HOME`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens:\n",
    "- **`ls $HOME`** produces a list of all files and directories in your home directory.\n",
    "- The pipe (`|`) takes this list and passes it to `grep`.\n",
    "- **`grep \"Documents\"`** then filters this list to show only the lines that contain \"Documents\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the pipe, you would need to first run `ls $HOME`, redirect the output to a file, and then run `grep` on that file. With the pipe, everything is done in one step, making the process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ps aux | grep firefox\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ps aux`** lists all running processes on the system.\n",
    "- **`grep firefox`** filters the list to show only the lines that contain \"firefox\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, you can use the pipe to find if the Firefox browser is currently running on your system. The pipe efficiently combines two commands without the need for intermediate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "The pipe operator is commonly used in scripts and on the command line to perform complex operations by chaining multiple commands together. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cat file.txt | sort | uniq\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command first displays the contents of `file.txt`, then sorts the lines, and finally removes duplicate lines. By combining these commands with pipes, you can achieve this result in a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `command1 | command2`:**\n",
    "- The pipe operator (`|`) allows you to use the output of one command as the input to another.\n",
    "- It is extremely useful for chaining commands together for complex operations.\n",
    "- Saves time and eliminates the need for intermediate files.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Command: `command1 | command2 > file1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command is an extension of the pipe operator (`|`). In addition to passing the output of `command1` to `command2`, the final output of `command2` is redirected to `file1` using `>`. Essentially, you are piping the output between two commands and then saving the final result in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "This command chains together two commands using a pipe and then captures the final output in a file. It’s a combination of the pipe (`|`) and output redirection (`>`), giving you both the benefits of piping and redirection.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, this command was explained using the following example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls $HOME | grep \"Documents\" > results.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "- **`ls $HOME`** produces a list of all files and directories in the home directory.\n",
    "- The pipe (`|`) sends this list to `grep`, which filters out the lines containing \"Documents\".\n",
    "- The `>` operator redirects the final filtered output to `results.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this command, you can open `results.txt` to see all the lines that contain \"Documents\" from the output of `ls`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "ps aux | grep firefox > firefox_process.txt\n",

    "- **`grep firefox`** filters the processes to find only those related to Firefox.\n",
    "- **`> firefox_process.txt`** saves the filtered output to `firefox_process.txt`.\n",

    "- **Efficient Processing**: It allows you to chain commands and save the final output in one step without creating intermediate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "Let’s say you are monitoring the system logs and want to find all entries related to network issues, then save them to a file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cat /var/log/syslog | grep \"network\" > network_issues.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`cat /var/log/syslog`**: Reads the system log.\n",
    "- **`grep \"network\"`**: Filters the log for lines containing the word \"network\".\n",
    "- **`> network_issues.txt`**: Saves the filtered output to `network_issues.txt`.\n",

    "By combining pipes and redirection, you can quickly find relevant information and save it for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Important Consideration:**\n",
    "Remember that using `>` will **overwrite** the contents of `file1` if it already exists. If you want to **append** the output to the file instead of overwriting it, you should use `>>`:\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this section, we will explain the remaining commands from the lecture: `/dev/null`, `command > file1 2> /dev/null`, `tee`, and `command1 | tee file1`. As with the previous sections, we will combine lecture content, additional examples, and explanations to provide a comprehensive understanding of these commands.\n",

    "### 7. **Command: `/dev/null`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "`/dev/null` is a special file in Unix/Linux systems, often referred to as a **\"black hole.\"** It discards anything written to it. When you redirect output or errors to `/dev/null`, they are effectively thrown away, disappearing without a trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "Normally, when a command produces output or an error, it is displayed on the terminal. However, there are situations where you don’t want to see the output or error messages—this is where `/dev/null` comes in handy. By redirecting output or errors to `/dev/null`, you suppress them from appearing anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following example was shown:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /nonexistentdirectory > /dev/null 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ls /nonexistentdirectory`** tries to list a directory that doesn’t exist, which generates an error.\n",
    "- **`> /dev/null`**: Redirects standard output (even though there isn’t any in this case) to `/dev/null`, discarding it.\n",
    "- **`2>&1`**: Redirects the error message to the same place as the output (which is `/dev/null`), thus discarding it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command effectively hides both the output and the error messages, so you won’t see anything on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use `/dev/null`?**\n",
    "There are several scenarios where you might want to use `/dev/null`:\n",
    "- **Suppressing Unnecessary Output**: If you're running a command or script and don’t care about its output, you can send it to `/dev/null` to avoid cluttering your terminal.\n",
    "- **Error Suppression**: Sometimes you want to hide error messages while allowing the command to continue running. Redirecting errors to `/dev/null` can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ping google.com > /dev/null 2>&1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command checks the connectivity to `google.com` but suppresses all output, including errors, by sending them to `/dev/null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "If you are running a background task that produces a lot of output you don’t need to see, you can send everything to `/dev/null` to keep your terminal clean:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "long_running_command > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Here, both the output and errors of the command are discarded, and the command is run in the background using `&`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `/dev/null`:**\n",
    "- `/dev/null` is a special file that discards anything sent to it.\n",
    "- Use it to suppress output and errors when you don’t need them.\n",
    "- Commonly used to keep terminal output clean and uncluttered.\n",

    "### 8. **Command: `command > file1 2> /dev/null`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command redirects the **standard output** to `file1` and sends the **standard error** to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing any error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "- **`> file1`**: Redirects the standard output to `file1`.\n",
    "- **`2> /dev/null`**: Redirects the standard error to `/dev/null`, discarding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a combination of two redirection techniques: one to save the successful output and one to suppress the error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, this command was used as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory > output.txt 2> /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ls /existingdirectory /nonexistentdirectory`** tries to list both an existing directory and a non-existent one.\n",
    "- **`> output.txt`**: Saves the successful output (listing of `/existingdirectory`) in `output.txt`.\n",
    "- **`2> /dev/null`**: Suppresses the error message generated by the non-existent directory `/nonexistentdirectory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the output file contains only the successful result, while any errors are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use This Command?**\n",
    "This command is useful when you care about the successful output of a command but don’t want to clutter your terminal or file with error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "find / -name \"*.log\" > logs.txt 2> /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command searches the entire file system for `.log` files and saves the list to `logs.txt`.\n",
    "- Any errors (e.g., permission denied messages) are suppressed by redirecting them to `/dev/null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "When running a script that processes multiple files, you might only want to log the successful operations and suppress any minor errors:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "process_files.sh > success.log 2> /dev/null\n",
    "```\n",
    "- In this example, only the successful operations are logged to `success.log`, and all errors are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `command > file1 2> /dev/null`:**\n",
    "- Saves the standard output to a file while suppressing error messages by sending them to `/dev/null`.\n",
    "- Useful when you only care about successful output and want to ignore errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Command: `tee`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "The `tee` command is used to **split the output** of a command into two destinations: it sends the output to both the terminal (standard output) and a file at the same time. This is useful when you want to view the output on the screen and save it to a file simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "- **`command | tee file1`**: The output of the command is passed to `tee`, which writes it to both the terminal and `file1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a unique command because it allows you to see the output in real-time while also saving it to a file for later reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following example was used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls $HOME | tee outputfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ls $HOME`** lists the files in the home directory.\n",
    "- **`| tee outputfile.txt`** writes the output of `ls` to both the terminal and `outputfile.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you will see the list of files printed on the terminal, and the same list will be saved in `outputfile.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use `tee`?**\n",
    "`tee` is extremely useful in situations where you want to monitor the output of a command in real-time while also keeping a record of it for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "df -h | tee disk_usage.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command checks the disk space usage of the system.\n",
    "- The output will be displayed on the terminal and saved to `disk_usage.txt` at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "When monitoring long-running processes or generating reports, you might want to see the progress on the screen while also saving it to a file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "long_process.sh | tee progress.log\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command shows the progress of `long_process.sh` on the terminal while simultaneously logging the output to `progress.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `tee`:**\n",
    "- `tee` splits the output of a command, sending it to both the terminal and a file.\n",
    "- Useful for real-time monitoring and logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Command: `command1 | tee file1`**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Explanation:**\n",
    "This command combines the use of the pipe operator (`|`) with `tee`, allowing you to pass the output of `command1` to another command while also saving the output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Does It Work?**\n",
    "- **`command1 | tee file1`**: The output of `command1` is passed to `tee`, which writes it to both the terminal and `file1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Lecture Example:**\n",
    "In the lecture, the following example was used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls $HOME | tee outputfile.txt | grep \"Documents\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ls $HOME`** lists the contents of the home directory.\n",
    "- **`| tee outputfile.txt`** saves the output of `ls` to `outputfile.txt` while also displaying it on the terminal.\n",
    "- **`| grep \"Documents\"`** filters the output to display only lines containing \"Documents.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this command:\n",
    "1. Lists the contents of the home directory.\n",
    "2. Saves the output to `outputfile.txt`.\n",
    "3. Filters the output to display only lines with \"Documents.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use This Command?**\n",
    "This is useful when you need to process the output of a command (e.g., filtering it with `grep`) while also saving the original output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Additional Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "ps aux | tee processes.txt | grep \"firefox\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`ps aux`** lists all running processes.\n",
    "- **`| tee processes.txt`** saves the process list to `processes.txt` and displays it on the terminal.\n",
    "- **`| grep \"firefox\"`** filters the list to show only processes related to Firefox.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "When troubleshooting a system or analyzing logs, you may want to save the raw output while also filtering for specific information:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tail -f /var/log\n",
    "\n",
    "/syslog | tee syslog.txt | grep \"error\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This command monitors the system log in real-time.\n",
    "- It saves the log output to `syslog.txt` and filters for lines containing \"error\" to display them on the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary of `command1 | tee file1`:**\n",
    "- Combines piping with `tee` to pass output between commands and save it to a file.\n",
    "- Useful for logging while also processing or filtering output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
