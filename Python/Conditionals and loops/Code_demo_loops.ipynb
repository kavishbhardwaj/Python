    "Interpreted Language Overhead:Python is an interpreted language, meaning it‚Äôs not as fast as lower-level languages like C or C++. Each Python statement is interpreted and executed at runtime, which adds overhead compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook Overhead: Jupyter adds additional overhead on top of Python. The kernel communicates back and forth between the notebook interface, which can slow things down. This is especially noticeable for CPU-bound tasks like adding large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, which severely limits the ability of Python to utilize multiple cores effectively. Even though your CPU has 12 cores and 20 threads, Python might not be fully utilizing them due to the GIL. This limits the parallelism that Python can achieve, meaning it won‚Äôt use all CPU threads efficiently for simple loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Overhead (Integers): Python handles arbitrary-precision integers, which means every integer is represented as an object. This introduces extra overhead compared to native integer types in languages like C that are fixed in size. When you are summing up large integers, the overhead of managing these objects can significantly slow down performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Management: Python‚Äôs memory management (automatic garbage collection, dynamic typing) adds overhead, especially in loops involving large numbers of operations. If the total variable grows large, Python needs to allocate more memory and manage the dynamic resizing of integer objects, further slowing down the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to Improve Performance:\n",
    "Use NumPy: NumPy is a highly optimized library that operates in C under the hood. You can use it to sum integers efficiently using vectorized operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try running the code in a standard Python script instead of Jupyter. Jupyter‚Äôs interactivity and its kernel‚Äôs communication with the front end can slow down tasks that involve many iterations or calculations.\n",

    "Use Cython or Numba: If performance is crucial and you're sticking with Python, you can use Cython or Numba to compile the code to a more efficient, low-level version.\n",
