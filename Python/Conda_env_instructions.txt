Here’s a more comprehensive guide that includes everything from proxy settings to using your environment for simulations and Jupyter notebooks.

### Step-by-Step Guide

---

#### 1. **Install Anaconda**:
   - Download the Anaconda installer from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - During installation, ensure "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" is checked.

#### 2. **Configure Proxy Settings for Conda**:
   
   ##### Proxy Server Configuration
   Create a `.condarc` file in your user directory to configure Conda’s proxy settings:
   - Open Notepad and add the following lines:
     ```yaml
     proxy_servers:
       http: http://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128
       https: https://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128
     ssl_verify: false
     ```
   - Save the file as `.condarc` in `C:\Users\kavish\` (ensure it’s not `.condarc.txt`).

   ##### Set System-Wide Environment Variables
   To make the proxy work across all applications, set environment variables for the proxy:
   
   - Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     setx HTTP_PROXY "http://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128"
     setx HTTPS_PROXY "https://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128"
     ```

#### 3. **Create Conda Environment for Simulations**:
   
   Create a Python environment tailored for your simulations:
   - Open **Command Prompt** (or Anaconda Prompt).
   - Run the following:
     ```bash
     conda create --name simulations_env python
     ```
   - Activate the environment:
     ```bash
     conda activate simulations_env
     ```

---

#### 4. **Install Required Python Libraries**:
   
   For physics simulations, install the necessary libraries. Run the following commands inside the activated `simulations_env`:

   - **NumPy and SciPy** (for numerical and scientific computations):
     ```bash
     conda install numpy scipy
     ```
   - **Matplotlib** (for plotting):
     ```bash
     conda install matplotlib
     ```
   - **QuTiP** (for quantum simulations):
     ```bash
     conda install -c conda-forge qutip
     ```

   (Add other libraries like ASE, OpenFermion as needed.)

#### 5. **Set Up Jupyter Notebook in VS Code**:
   
   ##### Install the Python and Jupyter Extensions:
   - Open **VS Code**.
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open the Extensions panel.
   - Install both the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions by Microsoft.
   
   ##### Create and Open Jupyter Notebooks:
   - Create a new file with the `.ipynb` extension in VS Code.
   - Select your `simulations_env` as the Python interpreter:
     - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for "Python: Select Interpreter".
     - Choose `simulations_env` from the list.
   
   Now you can run and edit Jupyter notebooks directly inside VS Code.

#### 6. **Install Git and Set Up Version Control (Optional)**:
   
   ##### Install Git:
   - Download and install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - During installation, select "Add Git to PATH".
   
   ##### Configure Git:
   - Open **Command Prompt** or **VS Code Terminal** and run:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "kavishbhardwaj"
     git config --global user.email "kavishbhardwaj@gmail.com"
     ```

   ##### Version Control:
   - Navigate to your local project folder.
   - Initialize a Git repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```
   - Add files and commit changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```
   - Link your local repository to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/kavishbhardwaj/cs50Python.git
     git push origin main
     ```

With these steps, you’ll have a fully functioning setup for advanced Python simulations, Jupyter notebooks, and version control on your local machine with proxy settings.
