Let's Retry the Same Process
Set the proxy variables again:

bash
Copy code
set HTTP_PROXY=http://kavish:Shivam!4!@10.31.31.10:8128
set HTTPS_PROXY=http://kavish:Shivam!4!@10.31.31.10:8128
Then, try running the environment creation command again:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name simulations_env python
This should bypass the proxy error again just like before. Let me know how it goes!

That's great! Now that the environment creation is working, let's proceed with the next steps:

Step 4: Activate the Conda Environment
Activate your new environment:

bash
Copy code
conda activate simulations_env
If it activates successfully, you'll notice the environment name (simulations_env) appear in parentheses at the beginning of the command line.

Step 5: Install Essential Python Packages
Since this environment is meant for advanced Python projects, let's install some essential packages for your work in simulations, physics, and 3D visualizations. Run the following command to install them:

bash
Copy code
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab
This installs:

Numpy: for numerical computations
Scipy: for scientific computing
Matplotlib: for plotting and visualizations
Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
JupyterLab: to provide a flexible environment for code notebooks
Step 6: Install Additional Visualization Libraries
You may also want to install these packages, depending on the visualizations you need:

bash
Copy code
conda install mayavi vtk
Mayavi: for advanced 3D scientific data visualization
VTK: the Visualization Toolkit for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization
Step 7: Verify Installation
Once everything is installed, check that it works properly by launching JupyterLab:

bash
Copy code
jupyter-lab
This should open a browser window with JupyterLab, where you can start coding with Python.

Let me know if you're able to proceed with these steps!

It seems like there's a conflict between the Python version and the Mayavi package. Mayavi requires a specific version of Python (3.6 or 3.7), but the environment you're working in has a more recent Python version (probably 3.12).

Here are a couple of ways to resolve this:

Option 1: Install Mayavi in a Separate Environment with Python 3.7
If Mayavi is critical to your project, you can create a separate Conda environment with Python 3.7 specifically for running Mayavi. Here's how:

Create a new environment with Python 3.7:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name mayavi_env python=3.7
Activate the new environment:

bash
Copy code
conda activate mayavi_env
Install Mayavi in that environment:

bash
Copy code
conda install mayavi vtk
This way, you can use this environment when you need Mayavi while keeping your simulations_env updated with Python 3.12 for other advanced tasks.

Option 2: Use an Alternative 3D Visualization Library
If you don’t specifically need Mayavi, you can use alternative libraries that are compatible with newer Python versions, such as:

Plotly: A powerful 3D visualization tool with support for interactive plots.
PyVista: A friendly interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), useful for 3D visualizations.
To install these in your current environment:

bash
Copy code
conda install plotly pyvista
