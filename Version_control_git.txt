1. Check Proxy Settings
Since you're using a proxy, make sure your Git configuration is aware of it. Run the following commands to set up your proxy for Git:

PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming> git config --global http.proxy http://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128
>> git config --global https.proxy https://kavish:Shivam%214%21@10.31.31.10:8128

2. Disable SSL Verification
If the SSL issue persists, you can temporarily disable SSL verification for Git by running this command:
PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming> git config --global http.sslVerify false

PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming> git clone https://github.com/kavishbhardwaj/cs50Python.git

3. Navigate to your cloned repository:
In the terminal (inside VS Code or Command Prompt), navigate to your cloned repository directory:

PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming> cd C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python

4. Check Git status:
To see the current status of your changes, use:
PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python> git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        "Here\342\200\231s a more comprehensive guide t.txt"
        Install mayavi.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

5. Stage the changes:
To stage all the modified files for commit, use:
PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python> git add . 

6. If you want to stage a specific file, you can do: git add <filename>

7.Commit the changes:
After staging your changes, you need to commit them. Add a message describing the changes you've made:
PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python> git commit -m "Your commit message here"
[main f816d2a] Your commit message here
 2 files changed, 247 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 "Here\342\200\231s a more comprehensive guide t.txt"
 create mode 100644 Install mayavi.txt
PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python> git push origin main

8. Push the changes to GitHub:
Now, push your committed changes to the remote repository:

git push origin main

Replace main with the correct branch name if your repository uses a different branch (e.g., master).

9. Enter credentials (if prompted):
If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or a Personal Access Token if GitHub requires it for authentication).
Additional Notes:
If this is your first time pushing, and you need to set the upstream branch, use this command instead:

git push -u origin main
Now your changes will be reflected in the GitHub repository! Let me know if you run into any issues during the process.

PS C:\Users\PLEXTEK\Documents\Programming\cs50Python> git push origin main
